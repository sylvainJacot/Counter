        SubAnswer : "1. Imperative (procedural) is like a receipt, computations are performed through a guided sequence of steps. 2. The Logical Paradigm takes a declarative approach to problem-solving. Various logical assertions about a situation are made. 3. The Functional Programming paradigm views all subprograms as functions in the mathematical sense-informally, they take in arguments and return a single solution. 4. Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm in which real-world objects are each viewed as seperate entities having their own state which is modified only by built in procedures, called methods.",
